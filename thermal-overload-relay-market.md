<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Overload Relay Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Melting Alloy Thermal Overload Relay</li><li>Bimetallic Strip Thermal Overload Relay</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermal overload relay market includes two key types: melting alloy thermal overload relays and bimetallic strip thermal overload relays. Melting alloy relays utilize a heat-sensitive alloy that melts at a specific temperature to break the circuit, providing protection against overheating. In contrast, bimetallic strip relays consist of two different metals bonded together that bend when heated, triggering a switch to interrupt the circuit. Both types are essential for safeguarding electrical equipment from damage due to excessive current.</p></p>
