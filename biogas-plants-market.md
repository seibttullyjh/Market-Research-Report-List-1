<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Digestion</li><li>Dry Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biogas plants can be categorized into wet digestion and dry digestion systems. Wet digestion involves processing liquid manure or organic waste with high moisture content, promoting anaerobic bacteria activity in large digesters. This method typically yields a consistent biogas output. In contrast, dry digestion processes feedstocks with lower moisture levels, often using a continuous or batch system. This approach is more suitable for solid waste, providing advantages in handling and reducing transportation costs while producing biogas efficiently.</p></p>
