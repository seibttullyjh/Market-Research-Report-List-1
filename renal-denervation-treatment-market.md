<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Renal Denervation Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radiofrequency</li><li>Ultrasound</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The renal denervation treatment market primarily comprises two types: radiofrequency and ultrasound. Radiofrequency renal denervation utilizes thermal energy to disrupt renal nerve activity, aimed at reducing hypertension. Conversely, ultrasound renal denervation employs focused ultrasound waves to achieve similar nerve disruption without necessitating incisions. Both techniques aim to provide effective hypertension management, with radiofrequency being more established, while ultrasound is emerging as a less invasive alternative. Together, these modalities cater to varying patient needs and preferences in hypertension therapy.</p></p>
